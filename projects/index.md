#### Heated etchant tank ####
I had a bash at making a heated PCB etchant tank but gave up halfway through as I no longer had the time to pursue the hobby enough to justify working on a tank. Currently I just use a jam jar with cupric chloride in it, I drop a bit of hydrogen peroxide in before etching a board to speed things up. I find it sufficient but otherwise if you're interested take a look at the relevant posts.
