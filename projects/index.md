## 2016 - Portable Dotfiles

After setting up many many servers by hand and recrafting my configurations I
bit the bullet and versioned [my
dotfiles](https://github.com/willprice/dotfiles) writing some scripts to install
them and haven't looked back since. Dotfiles are divided up by program into
folders which mirror the home directory sturcture for that specific program then
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) links these files into the home
directory.

## 2012 - Physical mailbox email notifier

One night I hacked together a little American style mailbox made out of
cardboard with an arduino and mini servo inside. It polled my email account and
would raise the flag if I had any unread email.

## 2011 - Heated etchant tank
I had a bash at making a heated PCB etchant tank but gave up halfway through as I no longer had the time to pursue the hobby enough to justify working on a tank. Currently I just use a jam jar with cupric chloride in it, I drop a bit of hydrogen peroxide in before etching a board to speed things up. I find it sufficient but otherwise if you're interested take a look at the relevant posts.
