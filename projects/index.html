<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>Here is a list of all the projects I've completed to date</p>
<br />
<p>I had a bash at making a heated PCB etchant tank but gave up halfway through as I no longer had the time to pursue the hobby enough to justify working on a tank. Currently I just use a jam jar with cupric chloride in it, I drop a bit of hydrogen peroxide in before etching a board to speed things up. I find it sufficient but otherwise if you're interested take a look at the relevant posts.
