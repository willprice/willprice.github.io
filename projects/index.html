      One of my third year courses at university was on the topic of
      computer graphics. The course revolved around implementing a
      raytracer and rasteriser from scratch given only a pixel canvas,
      everything else was up to us. I worked with a partner, Matthew
      Smith, and we built a MCMC path tracing raytracer with global
      illumination.

      After setting up many many servers by hand and recrafting my configurations I
      bit the bullet and versioned <a
        href="https://github.com/willprice/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> writing some scripts to install
      them and haven't looked back since. Dotfiles are divided up by program into
      folders which mirror the home directory sturcture for that specific program then
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU Stow</a> links these files into the home
      directory.

  <h2>2014 Three phase compiler (Haskell)</h2>

    <div class="eight columns" markdown="1">
      For my second year language engineering class we had to implement
      a compiler for an extended version of the <a
        href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~merro/files/WhileExtra_l.pdf"><code>While</code>
        language</a>. We were given java skeleton code for this project,
      but it was so poorly written that I gave up refactoring it and
      decided it would be easier to rewrite from scratch. I chose to
      write the compiler in Haskell as I'd heard great things about the
      language for compiler implementations and I'd yet to get the
      chance to build a non-trivial project in it.

      One night I hacked together a little American style mailbox made out of
      cardboard with an arduino and mini servo inside. It polled my email account and
      would raise the flag if I had any unread email.

      <p>I had a bash at making a heated PCB etchant tank but gave up
        halfway through as I no longer had the time to pursue the hobby
        enough to justify working on it.  Instead I used a jam jar with
        cupric chloride in it, pouring a bit of hydrogen peroxide in
        before etching a board to speed things up. I found it sufficient
        but otherwise if you're interested take a look at the relevant
        posts.</p>

      <p>I've always had a strong interest in electronics. My first break
        into the subject was through the book <a
          href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596153755.do">MAKE:
          Electronics</a> by Charles Platt. I blogged about my progress
        through the book as a way of consolidating my learning and sharing
        the trials I'd been through with others. This was a brilliant book
        that taught me a huge amount about basic electronics.</p>
