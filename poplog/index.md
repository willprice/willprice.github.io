# Poplog Resources
[Poplog server](http://ec2-46-137-67-65.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/)

A web-based SSH client is installed on the machine allowing for remote access over the internet inside the browser, currently the client being used (shellinabox) doesn't work with the poplog editor Ved, so until shellinabox supports xterm update mechanisms or Ved is modified, the server isn't of much use.

I have also produced a module for slax that allows easy access to a local poplog installation. Slax boots from a USB stick and changes are persistent across reboots. This is available on the Poplog server.
