I stumbled across this <a href="http://www.antonine-education.co.uk/Electronics_AS/Electronics_Module_1/Topic_2/topic_2_logic_gates_and_boolean_.htm">great website</a> in regards to basic electronics (for the AS Electronics course in the UK). Alas at the moment I don't have time to do much electronics or programming as I'm just about to start a month of exams, come the 20th June, I shall be back with hopefully some interesting posts!<br />See you then..</div>
