Chapter 2 focusses on the topic of 'Processing':<br />- How to get the IDE<div>- Introducing the 'sketchbook'</div><div>- Interface</div><div>- The processing reference</div><div><br /></div><div>Essentially it is quite a dull chapter if you have already used the Processing IDE before but to those new to it, it will prove a nice introduction as to how to use the IDE and the reference.</div><div><br /></div><div>One problem I have found is with 'publishing' my programs, when I export them, and I have a folder containing the code and index.html, when I open index.html I don't see my program, the layout is how it should be but just a box where my program should display. I'm not sure what is causing this problem so I may have a browse on the processing forums to try and find a remedy to this problem!</div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2537538144457618260-942999156816129209?l=willprice94.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
