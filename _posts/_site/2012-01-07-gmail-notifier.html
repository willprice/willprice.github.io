4 Years ago Tom Paton posted <a href="http://successlessness.blogspot.com/2007/07/ambient-email-notifier.html">this</a>&nbsp;and I asked him about his code, thus prompting him to post <a href="http://successlessness.blogspot.com/2008/02/ambient-email-notifier-some-code.html">this</a>. 4 Years later, now finally equipped with some know how and a little bit more experience with microcontrollers and programming, I thought this a fairly ideal project to have a bash at.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I adapted his python code to something a little more appropriate for my usage:<br /><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/1579856.js"> </script></div><div>(replace <b>username </b>and <b>password</b>&nbsp;with your username and password.

I've currently put a servo in a little mailbox made out of card and when I have an email the flag is raised. I'm working on getting the right sized enclosure and am currently using a Arduino Pro Mini which has no USB interface and I have to work out how to remedy this. Admittedly, this is a total waste of an Arduino as it's overkill for this project, but at the moment I don't have enough time to learn how to write C code for AVR micros, but when I do, I'll make this a little less wasteful and hopefully use a micro with USB support built in. But for the time being -- Arduino and USB to UART Adapter.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2537538144457618260-612302098802510241?l=willprice94.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
