I think it is very important to learn the theory so when it comes to learning different languages you still have a thorough understanding of the paradigm but you only have to pick up the new aspects of the language.</div><div><br /></div><div>Processing is a language based on visual interaction vs text-based interaction. A program is written with text, displayed using visual then can be interacted with via mouse clicks (amongst other devices). Text-based languages operate by being written in text, producing text and then being interacted with by more text. Enough rambling, onto the first chapter...</div><div><br /></div><div><b><u>CHAPTER 1: Pixels</u></b></div><div>This chapter focuses on 'Pixels', it describes how to draw some basic euclidean shapes (e.g. lines, circles and triangles etc), colour theory (grayscale, RGB, transparency) - that's about it. The book introduces different exercises to have a bash at to make sure you understand and can implement the theory - I personally find this the strong point on the book so far (Yes, I am only on chapter 2 at the moment!)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've learnt that the grid the computer draws is different to the "Cartesian coordinate system" (The one you use in mathematics at school). The x-axis is drawn from left to right (lower -&gt; higher value. This is the same as in the 'normal' graph system) however the y-axis is drawn from top to bottom, as you go down the y-value increases (not negatively).</div><div>I also have learnt how to draw - Rectangles, ellipses, triangles, lines and points, I know how to change line thickness, set the outline to be a different colour, set the inside to be a different colour etc. I don't quite understand how the colour mixing RGB system works yet, the mixing works like mixing lights; I've never really understood how that works thus I will check out a few tuts later on this week on the subject.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the end of the chapter you have to draw your own 'character' in processing, mine is fairly appalling compared to Shiffman's but it is original and I feel proud to have accomplished something. </div><div><br /></div><div>I tried to upload the code to openprocessing but it isn't displaying - not too sure why..</div><div>Here is the <a href="http://pastebin.com/ydR1kSPr">code</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
