I just received a fountain pen through the post today. I was a bit put out due to it not being in any packaging and being loose in a jiffy bag, upon reflection it occurred to me, this is great - no waste, the pen survive fine, no damage at all. I then remembered when I bought some DIP sockets from rapid, they sent 1 tube (roughly 1cmx1cmx60cm) in a 1mx0.5mx0.2m and stuffed it full of paper, surely the could use tubes that they use to send posters in instead?! It's infuriating how much the electronics industry waste, I've seen a few posts on sparkfun's packaging, it looks quite minimalist yet sufficient for the job, why can't more suppliers be like this!<br />Rant over.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2537538144457618260-9056381089453633515?l=willprice94.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
