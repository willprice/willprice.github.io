<b><u>Chapter 3: 'Interaction'</u></b><div><b><u><br /></u></b></div><div>Chapter 3 covers the 'flow' of a program; what <i>setup() </i>and <i>draw() </i>do and how to use them, mouse interaction, <i>dynamic </i>sketches and finally handling events (mouse clicks and key presses).</div><div><br /></div><div>I've learnt that <i>setup() </i>is run only once when the sketch is run, it sets the 'initialization code' as Shiffman puts it. After <i>setup(), draw() </i>is run, this runs, then loops back to the start of the code:</div><div><br /></div><div><i>void setup() {</i></div><div><i> //setup code</i></div><div><i>}</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>void draw() {</i></div><div><i>  //code which loops</i></div><div><i>}</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>The { } host a 'block of code' allowing one to manage code as an individual part of a program.</div><div><br /></div><div><u>MOUSE FUNCTIONS:</u></div><div><i>mouseX</i> - the current mouse x-coordinate</div><div><i>mouseY </i>- the current mouse y-coordinate</div><div><i>pmouseX </i>- the mouse x-coordinate in the previous run through <i>draw()</i></div><div><i>pmouseY - </i>the mouse y-coordinate in the previous run through <i style="font-family: Ubuntu, UbuntuBeta !important; ">draw()</i></div><div><i>void mousePressed() - </i>function that runs code when a mouse button is pressed</div><div><i>void keyPressed() -</i> function that runs code when a key on the keyboard is pressed</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I feel I have a good understanding of all the above, I am starting to realise how one goes about programming and how hard it will be in future implementing features, it shall definitely improve my logic, something I have been looking forward to doing, it's not very often we get stretched in school!</div><div><br /></div><div>This chapter completes 'Lesson 1' which covers the beginning of learning to program in processing. The end of lesson project is to create a dynamic sketch by interaction of the mouse and a static drawing. I have drawn a few things and added dynamics to them, currently I can't figure out how to export programs that actually display in webpages out, once I figure that out, they will be posted here.</div></div>
