title: "The Bowling Game Kata"

One of the classic Katas: [The Bowling
Game](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

I've pretty much reproduced Uncle Bob's solution as I had a huge amount of
trouble tackling this in an OO way. Jason has suggested I use linked lists to
keep track of the next frame and get the score from that, I'd avoided doing
something like that as I thought that would produce the 'inappropriate intimacy'
design smell, but I suppose it's better than having responsibilities in the
wrong place. 

I finish Uni this week so I'll have some more time to look at this problem. I'll
try and post a video where I refactor what I have into an OO solution :)
