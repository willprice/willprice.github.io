I was a bit bored with blogger seeing as there are many limitations which I'd like to get rid of, so I've installed wordpress on some free hosting<div><a href="http://willprice.comxa.com/">http://willprice.comxa.com/</a></div><div>Please tell me what you think, from an authors point of view, posting is now far more powerful and I can do lots more, e.g. use LaTeX to format equations, better support for embedding code etc. It makes my life easier.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm still in the process of sorting everything out, and moving the blog over, but it should be done pretty soon. I'll also be able to start blogging again quite soon (Exams are nearly over!)</div></div>
