title: "Unit testing is evil"
---

I'm currently reading 'Autotools', a book about, yes you guessed it, Autotools!
This passage made me laugh:

>Some people insist that unit testing is evil, but the only honest rationale they
>can come up with for not doing it is laziness. Proper unit testing is hard work,
>but it pays off in the end. Those who do it have learned a lesson (usually in
>childhood) about the value of delayed gratification.

I'm only reading the book so I can use the C unit testing framework
[check](check.sourceforge.net)... so yes. I have certainly learned a lesson in
the value of delayed gratification. Sometimes I wonder whether It's a bad
thing. Who knows whether I'll get my homework done before it's due date :)
