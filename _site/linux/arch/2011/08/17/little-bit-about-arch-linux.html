        <h2>A little bit about Arch Linux</h2>
        <div class='post'>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">I've recently switched from Ubuntu to Arch, which I have always wanted to do but time restrictions have been in the </span>way, since it's summer I've been able to dedicate a good chunk of time to do this. I have a few things I'd like to note about it for myself as a historical record.</div><div>
<br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">The installer did not work for me on the <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/download/">official download page</a>. I downloaded multiple isos from the <a href="http://releng.archlinux.org/">releng arch site</a> which proved futile, again with installer problems, I finally downloaded 08.15 which worked flawlessly from a local-core install (I didn't want to download the packages from the internet - netinstall as I have a rubbish connection). After this install I had my arch installation up and running, command line only using the nouveau kernel module I do believe (The terminal was full screen, which isn't the case without nouveau, nvidia doesn't run it fullscreen either)</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">A few bits and pieces on config files:</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">Added net-profiles and net-cfg to start my wireless connection at boot up (init level 3) that way I wouldn't have to touch it when I launch X. I had to add a config file in /etc/network.d/ for netcfg to work, which was based on wireless-wpa in the examples folder, this was easy, added pricelan, the name of my netcfg profile to rc.conf in the NETWORKS=() section. Installed dbus and ntfs-3g, the latter I edited my fstab to automatically mount on startup. I had to add avahi-daemon to daemons in rc.conf for rhythmbox to start properly otherwise it would take ages to start up.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">So now I wanted to setup my system, for the basics I Installed:</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Xorg &amp; nvidia for a graphical interface</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Xmonad for window managing (wonderful!)</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Links to browse the internet from the command line so I could read the wiki as I installed xorg etc, highly recommended.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Dmenu to launch programs in xmonad</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">Once I could launch X using the basic twm wm, I changed to xmonad, I did this by changing my ~/.xinitrc to launch xmonad, just placing 'xmonad' at the bottom of the file, nice and easy. When you launch X this time, you'll notice you just have a cross, press 'Alt-P' to launch d-menu and then some applications, 'man xmonad' has a good summary of the window tiling algorithm commands.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">Now to install my essential applications:</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Chromium for web browsing</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Rhythmbox for music</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- gnome-terminal</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">- Nautilus for file browsing</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">After installing these I couldn't get chromium to launch nautilus from the "Show in folder" dialog in downloads, I ammended this by installing 'perl-file-mimeinfo' which has the command 'mimeopen', it handles all the mimetypes so when you open files, it opens the proper program. After installing this chromium launched fine, however I had added the following lines to </span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list    and    ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
<br />"inode/directory=nautilus-folder-handler.desktop"</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">which may be needed, I don't know, I didn't try it without adding these lines.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">Rhythmbox won't open .pls files in the radio section as some gnome services aren't running, I know it isn't gnome-settings-daemon, or obviously the keyring daemon. I'll have to look further into this to try and remedy the issue, I hope to find the right service to run rather than running xmonad ontop of gnome, I prefer xmonad neat, gnome3 is horrid. Anyway, I don't need a DE, WM will do me fine.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">I'm still fiddling about with setting the wallpaper in xmonad, I'm using "xloadimage -onroot -fullscreen $path to image" at the moment which isn't stretching my 1980x1200 wallpapers to 1980x1080, A bit more exploration is required on my part to sort this out, once I have I'll be adding it to my ~/.xinitrc so when X starts my wallpaper will be set.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br />I have dipped my toes into xmonad configuration but the haskell syntax is a bit off-putting and I'm struggling with it at the moment but <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive/John_Goerzen's_Configuration">this</a> holds your hand quite well and I'm currently going through it. The xmonad wiki is pretty handy as well, I think this will take a while to produce decent results though.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br />I'd finally like to say I only switched to arch based on it's <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page">beautiful wiki</a>.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">
<br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">P.s. man does<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll"> jekyll </a>look good...</span></div></div>

I am indeed, it&#39;s very good, I would never learn so much if I were still using Ubuntu. I can see why both exist, I love Ubuntu for it&#39;s simplicity in terms of setup, but then I love Arch for it&#39;s simplicity in terms of configuration and ease to delve into your system, none of the details are abstracted away from you, they&#39;re all there for you to have a look at and play with, on the whole, I prefer the latter, I find my computer knowledge has vastly increased since using Arch and I&#39;m much less timid trying out things that I would have otherwise found daunting!<br /><br />Have you any experiences with Arch yourself?</div>

Are you still using Arch, how are you finding it?</div>
