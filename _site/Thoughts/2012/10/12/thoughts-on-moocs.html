        <h2>Thoughts on MOOCs</h2>
        <p>I&#8217;ve spent the last few months trying out some of the MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) from Udacity, Coursera and edX. I&#8217;ve taken CS101 (Udacity), Introduction to mathmatical thinking (Coursera), Introduction to logic (Coursera) and 6.002x (edX). I found the quality of the 6.002x videos too poor to continue but the exercises and labs were excellent &#8211; I may try and read the textbook and do the homeworks etc some time next year, but that&#8217;s no light task given that the text book comes in at a hefty 1009 pages.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Introduction to mathematical thinking&#8221; course so far has been the best (of the Coursera and edX course), the videos are very well done and it moves at a good pace with problem sets that are challenging. The release schedule leaves a lot to be desired, lectures are released on a Monday and Friday with tutorials on Wednesday, problem sets based on the lectures are in for the following Monday giving you the weekend to complete them. I&#8217;d much prefer to have a week to do the problems as it allows you to fit other things into your schedule rather than having to watch videos every other day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Introduction to logic&#8221; up to week 2 had been fine but now in week 3 the difficulty has been significantly ramped up, there is a lot more notation to internalise and apply to unfamiliar problems. I feel the jump from the examples in the lecture videos to the exercises is quite significant and leaves me confused. Hopefully I can push through the difficulty and understand the content but a reasonable amount of my understanding of the symbols is implicit from the lectures so I always feel a little unsure of whether my reasoning is correct. The notes are a rehash of the lectures (or vica versa) which isn&#8217;t so bad but I&#8217;d like more resources &#8211; fortunately in the forums people have posted links to relevant information which is a benefit of the course being run as a MOOC but I&#8217;m surprised given the level of participation in the course (~60,000 students) how few posts there are in the forum.</p>

<p>Overall it&#8217;s been interesting so far taking these course, but very time consuming and frustrating at times. I&#8217;ll continue to the end on ITMT, ITL if I can. I haven&#8217;t done that much of CS101 but it&#8217;s structure definitely fits me best so I&#8217;ll try and complete that over the next few weeks and have a look at the other CS courses Udacity offer.</p>
