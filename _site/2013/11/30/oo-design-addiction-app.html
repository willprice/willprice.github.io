        <h1>OO Design: Addiction app</h1>
        
        <p>From last week’s pairing session. Jason suggested I try and design my own
application from the principles he showed me (and demonstrates in his youtube
video). I decided I’d go for something a little simpler to make sure if I did
screw up, it wouldn’t be too time consuming to restart.</p>

<p>My application is going to be for smartphones, it will allow people to record
their ‘indulgences’ in their vices. For example, an alcoholic will be able to
record how often, and how much he/she drinks, then chart that to see whether they
are decreasing their consumption or not. A pretty simple idea, but especially as
this will be my first Android app, I thought I’d go for something reasonably
simple.</p>

<p>I wrote my user stories in Trello, acceptance tests around these user stories
are comments on the cards. I think I may have been pushing it, but I also used
it for my CRC cards; I wouldn’t recommend it for this though! Look at the boards
on <a href="https://trello.com/b/5QErUdSy/addiciton-app">Trello</a>.</p>

<p>I also made a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1np58VnMyYzhps_SrOcwW7bjJ2_tOr1R-aEpwweXU5tc/edit?usp=sharing">diagram</a> of the interactions between classes on google docs. I’m
not sure how complete it is. I spent quite a while trying to see whether I’d
missed any relationships, but I couldn’t spot any. At the same time it still
felt incomplete. Once I’ve done quite a few of these I hope I’ll be able to
churn them out quicker, currently I find them quite difficult and constantly
have to refer to examples to see whether I’m on the right path.</p>
