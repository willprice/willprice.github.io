### Processing 

Processing is fantastic. It lets you learn to program in a fairly simple manner (though Python's syntax is perhaps more appealing) to begin with and gradually build with more and more complexity finally allowing you to use all the features of Java inside your 'sketches' (Processing's name for programs) if you wish.

I first was seduced by Processing when I saw some interactive art demos online which were produced in Processing along with some interactive infographics that left me yearning to create similar results. Just checkout the processing homepage for excellent examples of work produced in the language: [processing.org](http://processing.org)

### Learning Processing
[Daniel Shiffman](www.shiffman.net/) wrote the book [Learning Processing](www.learningprocessing.com) which I feel is one of the best books to learn programming with, it teaches concepts in a very logical order; all without bogging you down in needless complexity.

I'd highly recommend it if you're unfamiliar with programming and are interested in getting started.
