- `printf("%d", var)` : print var to `stdout` providing var is a decimal
- `scanf("%d", &var)` : read from `stdin`, input assigned to `var`
- `&` : address operator, used to find the address of a particular variable : `address = &var`
- `return 0` : 0 indicates execution success, this should be present to tell the OS that the program executed proprely.

Operator precedence is defined by the usual rules, operators of same precedence are evaluated from left->right.
