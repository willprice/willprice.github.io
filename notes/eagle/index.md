# Eagle notes
* Add components
* Lay them out
* Use the `net` tool to connect them, *not* `wire`!
* Use ERC to check pins are connected
* Use DRC to check PCB layout is sane
* Smash ungroups components
* CTRL when moving snaps origin to closest grid space
* Eagle automatically flips silkscreens, spark funs gerber file flips
  silkscreens, we need to reverse this
