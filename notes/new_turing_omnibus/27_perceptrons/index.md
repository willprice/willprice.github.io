Biological Neurons' cell membrane can sustain an electrical charge, when
the charge reaches a certain threshold, the neutron fires meanining that
a wave of depolarization is sent down the neutron's axon, which splits
into the _dendritic tree_ where the wave reaches multiple synapses. If
the synapse is _excitory_ then the wave will cause the neighbouring
neuron's cell membrane to store a greater charge, if this charge is
sufficient, the neutron will fire. However, if the synapse is
_inhibitory_, the adjacent neuron will be restricted from firing for a
time.

It transpires that any proposition is logic can be realised by a network
of neurons.

_Perceptrons_ are neural networks that analyse visual patterns
represented to it as a grid. This is acheived by looking at certain
parts of the grid and weighting their values.0
