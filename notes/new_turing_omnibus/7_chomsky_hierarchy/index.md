Prior to understanding the Chomsky Hierarchy it's helpful to understand the following computing models:
- Finite Automata
- Pushdown Automata
- Linear Bounded Automata
- Turing Machines

First we'll cover the 4 computing models and then we'll talk about the Chomsky Hierarchy and how the computing models fit into it.
