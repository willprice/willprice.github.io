Finite automata are computational models that consist of internal
circuitry that exist in a finite number of stable equilibriums in
between states. 

A finite automaton has a set of states Q, a set of input
signals Epsilon and a function epsilon mapping members of Epsilon to Q.
There are 2 special states in Q, the initial state and the final state.
The set of input signals that make the automaton reach the final state
from the initial state are said to be the _language of the
automaton_ which are expressed through regular expressions.
