## Notes

These are my own notes relating to whatever I have been learning at the time posting. 
They do not purport to be correct or helpful, they are my own notes and as such 
are not polished or fact checked. Please don't contact me about
innacurracies in them as I may well already be aware of them. They are
for archival's sake.
