# Notes

- [Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](learn_you_a_haskell) - Some notes (up to
  chapter 6) whilst reading the book ["Learn You a Haskell for Great
  Good"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
- [DFRduino](dfrduino) - Obstacle avoiding robot outreach workshop for
  [Digimakers](http://www.digimakers.co.uk/)
- [ModuleSim documentation](modulesim) - Wrote this whilst doing the first year
  computer architecture unit at University of Bristol as there was no
  reference manual on how the hardware worked, it was later used to build some
  better docs: [ModuleSim documentation](https://bighexmachine.github.io/hexModuleSpec/)
