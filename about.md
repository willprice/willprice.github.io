I'm a PhD student supervised by [Dr. Dima
Damen](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/) and [Prof. Walterio
Mayol-Cuevas](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~wmayol/) at the [University of
Bristol](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/) studying computer vision and machine
learning. My research interests in probing trained neural networks to understand
where they succeed, where they fail and how we can reason about them. I've been
inspired by works such as 
[lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime),
[shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap), 
[excitation backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00507),
[network dissection](http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/)
and the research of [Anh Nguyen](http://anhnguyen.me/research/).

In addition to my research interests I come from a software development
background having been trained as an apprentice alongside by undergraduate
degree by 
[Jason Gorman](http://www.codemanship.co.uk/index.html). During my
apprenticeship and degree I've developed a particular fondness for the following
topics

* **Software development**: How do we write good software? What tools and
  processes can we use to accomplish these goals?
  Test driven development, agile, design patterns, programming
  languages, high assurance code, formal verification.
* **Automation**: How can I be lazier and offload more work onto the computer?
  Continuous integration, Build automation, Software defined networking.
* **Visualisation**: How do we make sense of all the data we collect
  these days?
