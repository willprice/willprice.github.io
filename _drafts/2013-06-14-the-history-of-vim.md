# History

`Ed` begat `Ex` which in turn begat `Vi`, and as we all know, `Vi` begat `Vim`.
Blimey... sounds a bit like Genesis doesn't it?

`Ex` is a superset of `Ed` despite being it's succesor. `Ed` is a good place to
start to explain the origin's of `Vim` as it's an interesting look at how
systems administrators, programmers, and users used to input text on a computer.
Ed was written by Ken Thompson; He took inspiration from the editor
[QED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_&#40;text_editor&#41;) which he had
previously used extensively at Berkeley.
