[Here we go
again](/2017/09/16/adventures-with-tft-screens-for-raspberry-pi.html)... After
the disaster of the Elegoo 3.5" screen I thought I'd buy some other screens,
this time from [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com), in particular from
a seller called [Geekworm](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1048722).

What did I order?

* [Geekworm Raspberry Pi 1080p OSD 3.5" HDMI IPS Display for Raspberry Pi
  3](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Raspberry-Pi-3-60Fps-1920x1080-OSD-3-5-inch-Touch-Screen-HDMI-IPS-Display-Screen-Case/32814146789.html)
  (note the seller has now changed the title from 1080p to 480x320 after I reported them
  to Aliexpress for misleading advertising)
* [Geekworm Raspberry Pi 1024x600 7" TFT Screen](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RasPi-7-Inch-Capacitive-Touch-Screen-Stander-for-Raspberry-Pi-3-B-2B-B-with-HDMI/32798691237.html)


What did I get

* A 3.5" screen with broken glass that when powered on turned out to have
  a 480x320 resolution and not 1920x1080...
* A decent 7" screen with damaged ribbon cable and an acrylic case that was so
  laughably poorly cut that you'd have thought that this was the producer's first
  attempt at using a laser cutter.
* No instructions for either case on how to assemble.
