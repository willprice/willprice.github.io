I've spent the last few months trying out some of the MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) from Udacity, Coursera and edX. I've taken CS101 (Udacity), Introduction to mathmatical thinking (Coursera), Introduction to logic (Coursera) and 6.002x (edX). I found the quality of the 6.002x videos too poor to continue but the exercises and labs were excellent -- I may try and read the textbook and do the homeworks etc some time next year, but that's no light task given that the text book comes in at a hefty 1009 pages. 

The "Introduction to mathematical thinking" course so far has been the best (of the Coursera and edX course), the videos are very well done and it moves at a good pace with problem sets that are challenging. The release schedule leaves a lot to be desired, lectures are released on a Monday and Friday with tutorials on Wednesday, problem sets based on the lectures are in for the following Monday giving you the weekend to complete them. I'd much prefer to have a week to do the problems as it allows you to fit other things into your schedule rather than having to watch videos every other day.

"Introduction to logic" up to week 2 had been fine but now in week 3 the difficulty has significantly ramped up, there is a lot more notation to internalise and apply to unfamiliar problems. I feel the jump from the examples in the lecture videos to the exercises is quite significant and leaves me confused. Hopefully I can push through the difficulty and understand the content but a reasonable amount of my understanding of the symbols is inferred from the lectures so I always feel a little unsure of whether my reasoning is correct. The notes are a rehash of the lectures (or vica versa) which isn't so bad but I'd like more resources -- fortunately in the forums people have posted links to relevant information which is a benefit of the course being run as a MOOC but I'm surprised given the level of participation in the course (~60,000 students) how few posts there are in the forum.

Overall it's been interesting so far taking these course, but very time consuming and frustrating at times. I'll continue to the end on ITMT, ITL if I can. I haven't done that much of CS101 but it's structure definitely fits me best so I'll try and complete that over the next few weeks and have a look at the other CS courses Udacity offer.
